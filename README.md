Maps api for starpeace

This library is the maps api for the java starpeace rebuild.

Using json defined map files and tilesets maps can be constructed passing the map name, the api then takes responsibility
for providing everything to do with the map, that the engine will need.

The example json files within the library were created using [Tiler](https://www.mapeditor.org/)

This library will be used with the OpenGl Engine for the rebuild of the client.
